# Quiz Game

This is a 5 question timed quiz to test ones knowledge of coding.

## description

The quiz begins with a set of rules de=isplayed on the page: you have 75 seconds to answer five questions. For every wrong answer the clock loses fifteen seconds . Your score is the amount of time left on the clock after you answer the last question. If the clock runs to zero then the game ends and your score is zero. This quiz relies mainly on javascript to run and has very little HTML and CSS.  Much of the styling and content is created in and delivered by Javascript.

## Credits

I used the tools that I've learned in Rice university Boot Camp as well as research in MDN and W3 schools online.  I also watched a video from the CodeExplained youtube channel that had similar aspects to this project [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pYIMygIcU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49pYIMygIcU).
